TODO: <br>
-There's a set of butterfly modules for each layer. Make 1 and store the intermediate values<br>
in RAM/registers. Design a controller to manage this. This will make reduce the amount of hardware <br>
needed and speed up synthsization. <br>
-Fix 16-point FFT (hard to do until optimized. <br>
-Develop UART Interface <br>
-test on an actual FPGA <br>
-Add better commenting/documentation <br>
<br>
Long Term: <br>
-Make VGA display control module <br>
-Find a way of doing audio input
